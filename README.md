Playing around with js: Just learning the basics of javascript and its cool features

Projects: Applying all the knowledge learned into various projects. Put my work into coding the starting hand of a famous card game (Contract bridge). All done using vanilla javascript and CSS.

More projects: Created a few sample projects to hone my HTML and CSS further (like using semantic tags and flexboxes), and then afterwards followed the Meta Front end development course to 
               create a few basic SPAs under "React" folder. The projects become more complicated (and I learn React.js in the process), with more features and lots of applying, googling, and 
               most importantly, learning! Created a little portfolio project using plain HTML and CSS (grids and flexboxes), and one using react as well.

Update: I have improved a lot in my react ability so I can safely say that these were the basic building blocks before I improved to purely React! Though I did do a lot of React projects in here too so do check them out.
